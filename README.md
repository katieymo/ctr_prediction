# Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction

This project was completed for my MIDS W261 Machine Learning at Scale class in Fall 2019.

Team members: Brent Biseda, Katie Mo, Teddy Fong, and Thanh Le

**Dataset**

The dataset for our final project is the [Criteo Display Advertising Challenge from 2014](https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge/overview). This dataset is a sample of the web traffic that CriteoLabs gathered in order to predict Click Through Rate.
